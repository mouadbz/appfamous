# How To Block Websites on iPhone (Safari or Chrome)

Whether you're trying to increase productivity, protect children from inappropriate content, or reduce distractions, blocking specific websites on your iPhone can be helpful. This guide covers methods for blocking websites in both Safari and Chrome browsers.

## Blocking Websites in Safari

Safari is the default browser on iPhone, and iOS provides built-in tools to restrict access to specific websites:

### Using Screen Time

1. Open Settings and tap on "Screen Time"
2. Tap "Content & Privacy Restrictions"
3. Enable "Content & Privacy Restrictions" if not already on
4. Tap on "Content Restrictions" > "Web Content"
5. Choose "Limit Adult Websites" to automatically block adult content
6. Under "Never Allow," tap "Add Website" and enter the URL you want to block

### Using Safari Content Blockers

1. Download a content blocker app from the App Store (like 1Blocker or AdGuard)
2. Go to Settings > Safari > Content Blockers
3. Enable the content blocker you installed
4. Configure the app to block specific websites

## Blocking Websites in Chrome

Chrome doesn't have built-in website blocking on iOS, but you can use these workarounds:

### Using Screen Time to Block Chrome Entirely

If Chrome is being used to bypass Safari restrictions:

1. Go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions
2. Tap "Allowed Apps"
3. Toggle off Chrome to prevent its use entirely

### Using DNS-based Blocking

1. Install a DNS filtering app like NextDNS or CloudFlare's 1.1.1.1
2. Configure the app to block specific domains
3. This will block websites across all browsers on your device

## Using Third-Party Apps

Several apps can help manage website access across your device:

- **Freedom**: Comprehensive blocking across apps and websites
- **BlockSite**: Simple website and app blocking
- **FocusMe**: Advanced scheduling and blocking features
- **Cold Turkey**: Powerful blocking with detailed statistics

These apps often require setting up a VPN configuration on your device to filter all web traffic.

## Router-Level Blocking

For whole-home protection:

1. Access your router's admin panel
2. Look for "Parental Controls" or "Access Restrictions"
3. Add websites to the blocked list
4. Apply settings to specific devices or all devices

## Tips for Effective Website Blocking

- Create a strong Screen Time passcode that others won't easily guess
- Use a combination of methods for more comprehensive blocking
- Consider using router-level blocking for whole-home protection
- Regularly review and update your blocked websites list
- Test your blocking setup to ensure it's working properly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Websites Still Accessible

- Check if you're using a different browser
- Verify VPN or proxy settings aren't bypassing restrictions
- Ensure Screen Time restrictions are properly configured

### Blocking Too Restrictive

- Review your "Always Allow" list
- Adjust time-based restrictions
- Consider using scheduled blocking instead of permanent blocks

By implementing these methods, you can create a safer browsing environment and reduce digital distractions on your iPhone. The key is finding the right balance between restriction and functionality for your specific needs.
